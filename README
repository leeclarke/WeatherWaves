WeatherWaves is still in development and wont do anyone much good just yet. Check back soon though because this shouldn't take too long to finish off!

The goal for WeatherWaves is to produce a service that can return Weather Underground data in both Wave and JSON formats as well as to provide a portable utility that can be reused in an Android application that I am building. That's not bad mileage out of one little utility I think!
